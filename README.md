# bigu

This is a response to a Reddit
[thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/axxy73/very_new_to_rust_wanted_to_test_it_got_bitten/). It
contains correct implementations of programs that print a
big number to standard output in Rust, Python 3 and Nickle.

Current timings on my box:

* `bigu.py`: 6.0s
* `bigu.rs`: 7.3s
* `bigu.5c`: 38s
